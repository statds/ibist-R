\description{
A large observational dataset from a cohort study conducted in Japan
to examine the association between non-restorative sleep (NRS) and
physical activity, gender, and age. The data are used to illustrate
logistic regression modeling for a binary outcome in a large-sample
setting.
}
\details{
Non-restorative sleep (NRS) is defined as a subjective feeling of lack
of refreshment on awakening and reflects qualitative aspects of sleep.
Hidaka et al. (2019) analyzed these data using logistic regression to
assess whether the probability of NRS is associated with physical
activity, gender, and age in a large cohort of adult subjects in
Japan. Within this package, the dataset is provided for methodological
illustration of binary regression models rather than for substantive
epidemiological inference.

All variables are stored as integer codes. Missing values are
represented as \code{NA}.
