\title{Demonstrate the Central Limit Theorem}
\usage{
demo_clt(rng, n, nrep = 10000, ..., mean = NULL, sd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rng}{A random number generator function taking the sample size
as its first argument (e.g., \code{runif}, \code{rnorm},
\code{rgamma}).}

\item{n}{A numeric vector of sample sizes (e.g., \code{c(5, 10, 20,
40)}).}

\item{nrep}{The number of repetitions for generating sample means
(default is 10000).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the random number generator
(e.g., \code{shape} and \code{rate} for \code{rgamma}).}

\item{mean}{The theoretical mean of the distribution. If \code{NULL},
it is estimated from a large Monte Carlo sample.}

\item{sd}{The theoretical standard deviation of the distribution.
If \code{NULL}, it is estimated from a large Monte Carlo sample.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object showing the standardized sampling
  distributions for different sample sizes, compared against the
  standard normal curve.
}
\description{
The \code{demo_clt()} function generates plots to illustrate the
Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using a specified random number generator.
The function displays standardized sampling distributions for
different sample sizes and overlays the standard normal density.

  n = c(5, 10, 20, 40),
